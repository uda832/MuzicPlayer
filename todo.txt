CurrentTask:
**********************************************************************
    - Major Design Update:
        + Implement HostFragment class
        + Modify MainActivity.java

        TESTS:
            - Compiling?
            - ViewPager + TabLayout loaded?





    - Bugfix: audioFocusGain starts playing (even when playback is paused)



    - Set up Fragments:
        - Albums
            - Albums.OnItemClick behavior
                - Replace ViewPager fragment with Album fragment 






            - Album Fragment:
                - 1/3 Screen with art, name, artist, year, total duration
                - ListView Tracks (trackNum, TrackName, duration)


            CurrentTask:
                - 


   
//end**********************************************************************

NextTask:
    - Mods:
        - Empty albums and songs should have placeholder artwork


    - Set up Fragments:
        - Songs
            - LongClick for contextual action mode (CheckBox)
                - Menu:
                    - Add selected songs to playlist
        - Artists:
            - ListView Item:
                - first album artwork, artistName, numTracks 
            - Single Artist:
                - Title=ArtistName
                - Expandable ListView Item:
                    - Album(art, year)
                        - ontouch to expand/collapse
                        - tracks ListView
        - Playlists
    - Now Playing SlidingPanel
        - Fav button Functionality
                - auto add to "Favourites" playlist
                - Adapter.getView: check if it exists in "Favourites" playlist
        - Prev, Play/pause, Next
        - Shuffle Button
    - Make panel draggable only on "Metadata", and "ControllerBar" section
 

Bugs:
    - While paused, getting a message starts playing
    - Audio_focus temporary loss (i.e. message) breaks app
    + Inflate fail (onCreateView invoked only when viewPager is scrolled)
        * Issue: onCreateView is called before populateSongsList is called


TESTS before deploying:
    - Analyze memory consumption (compared to other music players)
        - Look for room to optimize usage
    - Analyze CPU usage (while visible vs. in the background)



FutureTasks:
    - Now Playing SlidingPanel
        - MoreMenu -- Handle actions
                - Go to Artist

                - Settings
    - Animate hide when fragment is scrolled
    - Use headphone controllers
        - Defaults (pause/play, double-click to playNext, triple for prev etc.)
    - SongAdapter:
        - Need to grab images (leave artwork for now)
    * Contextual Action Menu
        * Add to playlist
    * Alphabetical Scroll Bar


Possible Features:

    * Background: fill/fade with current artwork 
    * Background: soundcloud-like animate according to playtime
