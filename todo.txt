Current Task:
   





    - Now Playing Activity
        - Action bar Setings menu
            - Add to Playlist
            - Settings
        - LongClick on Image Popup/Context menu
            - Go to Artist
            - Go to Album
        - Controls:
            - Soundcloud-like waveform to scroll through song
            - Fav button (auto add to "Fav" playlist)
            - Current time, total-current time 
            - Shuffle
            - Prev, Play/pause, Next




    

Bugs:
    - Audio_focus temporary loss (i.e. message) breaks app
    - Selecting a song while paused doesn't refresh play button
    - Inflate fail (onCreateView invoked only when viewPager is scrolled)


TESTS before deploying:
    - Analyze memory consumption (compared to other music players)
        - Look for room to optimize usage
    - Analyze CPU usage (while visible, in the background)



Future Tasks:
    - Animate hide when fragment is scrolled
    - Use headphone controllers
        - Defaults (pause/play, double-click to playNext, triple for prev etc.)
